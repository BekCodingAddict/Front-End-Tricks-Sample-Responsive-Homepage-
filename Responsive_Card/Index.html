    <p><address>Typically, a full stack engineer is proficient in front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as front-end frameworks like Angular, React, or Vue. They are also skilled in back-end technologies such as server-side programming languages (e.g., Python, Ruby, PHP, Node.js), databases (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL), and server-side frameworks like Express, Flask, or Django. Additionally, full stack engineers often have knowledge of version control systems, deployment, and testing techniques.

        Full stack engineers are highly adaptable and can work on different parts of the web development stack based on project requirements. They can create responsive user interfaces, handle server-side logic, manage databases, and implement security measures, among other tasks. Full stack engineers are often sought after in the software development industry due to their versatility and ability to handle end-to-end development projects.</address></p>
