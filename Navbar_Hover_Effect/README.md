### About

Navbar hover effect refers to the visual changes or animations that occur when a user hovers their cursor over a navigation bar (navbar) element on a website or application. It is a form of interactivity that can enhance the user experience by providing visual feedback and making the navigation bar more engaging and visually appealing.

Navbar hover effects can vary depending on the design and style of the website or application, but some common examples include:

1. Changing the color or background of the navbar element when hovered over, often to a contrasting color or a highlight color.
2. Adding animations such as fading, sliding, or scaling effects to the navbar element to create a smooth transition when hovered over.
3. Displaying additional information or options when the navbar element is hovered over, such as dropdown menus or tooltips.
4. Changing the shape or size of the navbar element when hovered over, such as making it larger or adding a border.
5. Changing the font size, weight, or style of the text within the navbar element to create emphasis or highlight the selected option.

Navbar hover effects can be implemented using various web technologies such as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), JavaScript, and libraries or frameworks like Bootstrap or Materialize. They are often used in web design to enhance the visual aesthetics, interactivity, and usability of navigation bars, making them more intuitive and engaging for users.
