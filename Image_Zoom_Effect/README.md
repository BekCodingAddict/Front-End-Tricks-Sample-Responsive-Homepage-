# Image Zoom Effect

<h3>About...



Image hover zoom effect is a visual effect that occurs when a user hovers their mouse pointer over an image and the image enlarges or zooms in to provide a closer view. The effect is often used to draw attention to images and can be used on websites, social media platforms, and in various other contexts.

When the user hovers over the image, JavaScript or CSS code is triggered that increases the image size and displays it in more detail. The zoom effect can be customized to vary in intensity or duration, and can include other visual effects such as blur or opacity changes.

Image hover zoom effects are commonly used in e-commerce websites to display product images in greater detail, but they can also be used in photo galleries, art portfolios, or any other context where images are a central part of the user experience.
